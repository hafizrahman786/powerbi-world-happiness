# üåç World Happiness Data Analysis (Power BI Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness). The goal is to explore global happiness levels, identify regional differences, and understand key factors influencing happiness across countries.  

The analysis is done in **Power BI** and includes interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## üìä Dashboard & Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into global happiness through different visualizations:

1. **Happiness Score by Region**  
   - Bar chart showing average happiness scores across regions.  
   - Highest scores observed in *Australia & New Zealand, North America, and Western Europe*.  
   - Lower scores in *South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa*.  

2. **Factors Contributing to Happiness**  
   - 100% stacked bar chart for selected countries (e.g., Ireland, Austria, Iceland, Nigeria).  
   - Compares contributions from GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption.  

3. **Impact of GDP per Capita on Happiness**  
   - Scatter plot comparing GDP per capita with happiness score.  
   - Clear positive relationship: higher GDP often leads to higher happiness, but not the only factor.  

4. **Happiness Score Trend Over Time (2015‚Äì2019)**  
   - Line chart showing regional trends.  
   - Some regions remain stable (e.g., Western Europe), while others show slight declines.  

5. **World Happiness Map**  
   - Filled map visualization of happiness scores across countries.  
   - Highlights global variation at a glance.  

## üîë Key Insights
- Wealthier regions generally report higher happiness scores.  
- Non-economic factors (social support, health, freedom) play a critical role.  
- Regions like **Sub-Saharan Africa** consistently score lower, pointing to socio-economic challenges.  
- Happiness trends are relatively stable over time with slight variations.
